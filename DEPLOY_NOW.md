## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Repository not found"
**Fix:** Create the repo on GitHub first at https://github.com/new

### ❌ "Permission denied"
**Fix:** Check your GitHub credentials
```powershell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### ❌ "Model file too large"
**Fix:** Model will auto-train on first run (takes 2-5 min)

### ❌ "Module not found" on Streamlit
**Fix:** All dependencies are in `requirements.txt` - should work automatically
