- Each packet shows:
  - Attack type with icon
  - Source IP → Destination IP
  - Confidence percentage
  - Timestamp

**What to do:**
- Just watch! It updates automatically every 2-3 seconds
- Adjust speed with the slider in sidebar

---

### **Tab 2: 🚨 ACTIVE ALERTS**

**What you see:**
- List of all detected threats
- Color-coded by severity:
  - 🔴 Red = CRITICAL
  - 🟡 Yellow = WARNING
  - 🟢 Green = INFO

**What to do:**
1. Click **🚫 BLOCK** button on any alert
2. IP gets blocked immediately
3. Alert shows "BLOCKED" status

**Try this:**
- Filter alerts by severity using the dropdown
- Block a few IPs to see them in the blocked list

---

### **Tab 3: 🔒 IP MANAGEMENT**

**What you see:**
- Left side: List of blocked IPs
- Right side: Manual blocking form

**What to do:**
1. **To unblock:** Click ✅ Unblock next to any IP
2. **To manually block:** 
   - Type IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - Click 🚫 BLOCK IP

**Try this:**
- Block an IP manually: `192.168.1.50`
- Then unblock it to see the action

---

### **Tab 4: 📈 ANALYTICS**

**What you see:**
- Pie chart: Attack type distribution
- Bar chart: Severity levels
- Line chart: Threat timeline

**What to do:**
- Hover over charts to see details
- Let monitoring run for 1-2 minutes to collect data
- Charts update automatically

**Insights you get:**
- Which attacks are most common
- Threat severity breakdown
- Patterns over time

---

### **Tab 5: 🛠️ THREAT INTEL**

**What you see:**
- Expandable sections for each attack type
- Descriptions, severity, mitigation steps

**What to do:**
1. Click on any attack type to expand
2. Read the description
3. See recommended mitigation strategies

**Educational content:**
- Learn about DoS attacks
- Understand probe reconnaissance
- Know how to mitigate threats

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Problem: "Model not found"
**Solution:**
```powershell
python src/train_ids.py
```
Wait for training to complete (2-5 minutes)

---

### ❌ Problem: Training shows matplotlib popup
**Solution:** 
Already fixed! The popup won't block anymore. Just run:
```powershell
python src/train_ids.py
```

---

### ❌ Problem: "streamlit is not recognized"
**Solution:**
Use `python -m` prefix:
```powershell
python -m streamlit run app_executive.py
```

---

### ❌ Problem: Dashboard looks plain/not styled
**Solution:**
- Use Chrome or Edge browser (best support)
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
- Refresh page (Ctrl + R)

---

### ❌ Problem: No threats appearing
**Solution:**
- Make sure you clicked ▶️ START
- Wait 5-10 seconds for first packets
- Check that model is loaded (green status)

## 📊 What the Data Means

### **Attack Types:**
- **DoS** (Denial of Service) = Overwhelming server with traffic
- **Probe** = Scanning network for vulnerabilities
- **R2L** (Remote to Local) = Unauthorized remote access
- **U2R** (User to Root) = Privilege escalation
- **Normal** = Legitimate traffic

### **Confidence Score:**
- **90-100%** = Very confident detection
- **70-89%** = Good confidence
- **Below 70%** = Not shown (filtered out)

### **Threat Levels:**
- **LOW** = <20% malicious traffic
- **MODERATE** = 20-50% malicious
- **HIGH** = >50% malicious
